#### Gene expression analysis (RNASeq) using R
This repo contains instructions for differential expression of RNA-Seq (gene expression) data using the DESeq package, starting with raw counts of sequencing reads.
The dataset used is the Pasilla dataset, available from the Pasilla Bioconductor library. It contains RNA-Seq count data for RNAi treated and untreated *Drosophila melanogaster* cells.

There are two documents: RNASeq.R and RNASeq_with_DNASeq.md, which shows the code and expected output, as well as extra notes.
