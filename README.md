### Gene expression analysis (RNASeq) using R
This repo goes through the workflow of differential expression of RNA-Seq (gene expression) data using the DESeq package, starting with raw counts of sequencing reads.
The dataset used is the Pasilla dataset, available from the Pasilla Bioconductor library. It contains RNA-Seq count data for RNAi treated and untreated *Drosophila melanogaster* cells.

### Documents:  
RNASeq.R  
RNASeq_with_DNASeq.md goes through the workflow.
